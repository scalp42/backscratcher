"Every good work of software starts by scratching a developer's
 personal itch."
  - Eric Raymond

This is a collection of small programs I have developed over the years
to take care of various tasks on the computer. Perhaps the one I use
most is 'tps' (turbo-ps), which lets me grep the output of ps with
strings rather than pids.

Another one I use a lot is fx (effects). It can do a number of tricks
to issue a command on each of a collection of files, even commands
that ordinarily only operate on a single file.

        <complete list of programs and what they do goes here>

You may notice that some of these are written in only perl while
others have a python version and some are only in python. I learned
perl first and used it alongside the tcl-based expect tool until I
discovered python and realized that it provides pretty much everything
perl and expect do in a single tool. I'm not a performance wonk, I
just want to get the job done, so I didn't worry too much about
whether python is as fast or efficient as perl. I just jumped in.

So now I'm in the middle of converting all these programs to python.
